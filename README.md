#### Authors
Changming Xu, Ran Wan, Diqiu Zhou

#### Note

Some of these methods take an extremely long time to run (hours). Specifically ARIMA and RNN.

#### Packages
In order to run the code you will need to install all of the following packages. The code is also written in Python 3, may need changes to be run in python 2.

* Matplotlib
* Statsmodels
* scikit
* numpy
* pandas
* keras

They can be installed with the following line.

```
pip3 install matplotlib statsmodels scikit numpy pandas keras
```

#### Dataset
The data file is too big to upload to Github so you have to download it mannually.  Visit the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data) and find *bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2017-10-20.csv* and place it in data folder.

#### Running code

To run each method simply use

```
python <method_name>.py
```
